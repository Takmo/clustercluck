# Clustercluck #

Failure-Tolerant Distributed Clucking Goodness

==========

This project is a simple joke meant to annoy my co-workers. Each node in
the cluster is designated as a 'hen'. These hens collectively implement
RAFT, allowing them to reach consensus on commands to execute.

Commmands:

* cluck - write 'Cluck!' to the system log.
* hatch - add a new hen to the cluster.
* pluck - remove a hen from the cluster.
* roost - shut down the cluster.

I do not expect this to work anywhere except for my company's test machines.

Thanks and Gig 'Em!
